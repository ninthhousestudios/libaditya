    the primary interface into libaditya is the Chart
    Chart is a collection of vargas

    it explicity includes a Rashi chart Chart.rashi()
    any implemented varga can gotten by Chart.varga(varga_code)

    can return a new Chart that has different options set
    aditya(),tropical(),sidereal() all have certain options they set, any others can be passed as keyword arguments, e.g., ayanamsa=27
    defaults are documented in those functions

    Jaimini and Tajika inherit from Chart, and they are here to give syntactic functionality to this
    simply for ease of use; explained more in a code comment

    the actually functionality is provided through Varga and on down.

    where the syntax for chart=Chart() is chart.jaimini().first_strength()
    .first_strength() actually belongs to Varga...so on any varga you can call
    Varga.jaimini_first_strength()

    not sure this syntax is really worth it? leaving it for now
